I have extended the deadline by one day to Friday 10/16. Complete the project by Wednesday 10/14 for 2 early submission extra credit points. Complete the project by Thursday 10/15 for 1 early submission point. Get started this week!\n\nIn order to give you a chance to attend Discussion 5 and review solutions to Homework 5, I have delayed Quiz 2 by two days. It will be released on Friday 10/9 and is due Monday 10/12. The quiz is only 2 points and should not take much time, but does require you to understand the Python object system.\n\nHistorically, some students have fallen behind at this point in the semester. Catching up after you fall behind in lecture material is not fun; you&#39;re highly encouraged to watch lecture the day it is released. \n\nOne great way to make sure that you watch lecture the day it&#39;s released is to attend live lecture in Wheeler Hall. There&#39;s plenty of room. Perhaps I&#39;ll see you tomorrow at 2pm.\n\n#pin', u'I have updated the syllabus to include a more detailed description of how we are going to calculate midterm recovery points. \n\nIf you scored below 20/40 on the midterm you are eligible for midterm recovery points depending on discussion attendance and lab participation. I&#39;ve included the exact logic used to calculate the amount of points you can expect to receive back.\n\n<pre>def recovery_points(your_score, labs, discussions):\n    attendance = labs &#43; discussions\n    max_recovery = max(0, 20 - your_score) / 2\n    return max(0, max_recovery - (5 - attendance)) \n</pre>\n\n\n#pin', u'<script type="text/javascript">PA.load("/dashboard/project_partners", null, function(data){ $(\'#\' + \'questionText\').html(data);});</script> #pin', u'<p>Can someone please explain how to approach 3b?
